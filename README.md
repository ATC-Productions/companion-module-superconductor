# Bitfocus Companion Module: SuperConductor for CasparCG

This is a **Bitfocus Companion** module for controlling SuperFlyTV's **SuperConductor** for CasparCG. The module currently supports basic operations such as:

- Playing, pausing, and stopping groups across multiple rundowns.
- Basic preset functionality for quick workflow optimization.

Please note: the API used by this module is an **internal, limited, and unstable HTTP API**. While it has been available since the last release of SuperConductor in 2024, it may undergo changes that could impact this module's functionality.
